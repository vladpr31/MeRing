# MeRing

### What Is It?
#### MeRing is a medical evaluation ring which suggests a possible solution for elderly people who live alone(such as hostels or even at their homes).

The idea came from a time I was reading the news(multiple times at different times) when I saw "elderly person found lifeless" after a week, the cause? a heart attack.
So the main idea of this Ring is your monitor person's vitals like Heart Rate, Oxygen Saturation and such.
(Most of the idea is fictional, as some things about it not possible technologically.[Yet..]).
The ring supposedly acts as an "Alarm" for medical centers, but it's app allows more options such as:

##### -Creating Appointments.
##### -Checking Doctor's Recommendations.
##### -Tracking own vitals.(Blood Pressure etc.)
#### -Information about available Doctors and their Rating\Location and such.
and more.
##### (It's a mockup).

As soon as there is no Heart Beat from the Patient, it will alret the medical center and call an ambulance.
(if its not a malfunction, which in this case needs a solution for it.)

# Product landing page - 
As part of self-learning Web Development I've had the idea to create a Webpage for this product.
For now it's still work in progress as I do try new stuff\libraries\apis.
